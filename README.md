# React-Static Port of https://github.com/sdras/smashing

This is a react-static port of https://github.com/sdras/smashing but it has been extended to demo some other functionality of Netlify Functions and Netlify Dev for the lunch workshop on [Develop, Test, and Deploy Serverless Functions with Netlify](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/lunch-sessions).
